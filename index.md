# Knowledge Representation and Semantics Working Group Pre-Symposium at AMIA 2023

# Scope

We invite contributions and participation in 2023 [Knowledge Representation and Semantics Working Group](https://amia.org/community/working-groups/knowledge-representation-and-semantics) Pre-Symposium at AMIA 2023.
The half-day workshop will be held on Saturday, Nov 11, 2023 8:30 AM - 12:00 PM CST as part of official 2023 American Medical Informatics Association Pre-Symposium activities.

The objective of this pre-symposium collaborative workshop is to enhance awareness of knowledge representation and semantics approaches within biomedical informatics;
to provide a venue to disseminate new developments in the field; and to facilitate new collaborations.

This instance of the workshop will include a special focus on knowledge representation approaches in combination with other artificial intelligence approaches, and will feature a panel of informaticists engaged in this effort. 

Panelists include:
* Mathias Brochhausen, Ph.D., University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
* Zhe He, Ph.D., Florida State University
* Oliver He, Ph.D., University of Michigan


We invite submissions of two-page abstracts for podium talks on research and applications of knowledge representation approaches across the breadth of the biomedical informatics domain areas.
Previous instances of the workshop have included diverse submissions and presentations on knowledge representation work in many areas of informatics, including:

* cancer informatics
* imaging informatics
* neuroinformatics
* public health and policy informatics
* clinical research informatics
* drug informatics
* foundational knowledge representation and reasoning methods

The 2023 workshop will have a special emphasis on AI for health projects that combine knowledge representation and semantics approaches with complementary work in the areas of machine learning,
deep learning, and natural language processing with large language models.
Submissions specifically about KRS in AI for health will be presented in their own session followed by a panel-led open discussion of the topic.

Submissions may include:

* Abstracts for preliminary results from in-progress research;
* Abstracts for incremental improvements on already published research;
* Abstracts for systems / software artifacts currently in development (but in a demonstrable state). This session will allow researchers to quickly disseminate new results, and to receive feedback on their in-progress research before submission to a larger conference or journal venue. Accepted abstracts in this category will be presented by poster or live system demonstration.

Please follow the standard AMIA formats for all submission types. Accepted papers/abstracts will be asked to submit multiple choice questions so that attendees may use this workshop for MOC-II credit.


# Learning Objectives:
After participating in this session, attendees should be better able to:
1. Understand the state of the art in knowledge representation and semantics in biomedicine.
2. Appreciate the breadth of the field, including works published/presented in venues other than AMIA.
3. Foster potential new collaborations among researchers who have similar research interests.
4. Understand and discuss applications of knowledge representation and semantics approaches as part of the larger effort to bring artificial intelligence solutions to biomedical 




# Important Dates
* *Deadline*: September 18, 2023.
