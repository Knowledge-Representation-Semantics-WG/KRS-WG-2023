# Knowledge Representation and Semantics Working Group Pre-Symposium at AMIA 2023

# Scope

We invite contributions and participation in the 2nd Annual Knowledge Representation and Semantics Working Group Pre-Symposium at AMIA 2019. The workshop will be held on Sunday November 17, 2019 from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM. There are three submission categories for this half-day workshop:


Doctoral Consortium
PhD Candidates may submit a 5-page summary, including references, of their in-progress dissertation research. Selected students will present their work and receive feedback from a panel of experts. The goal of the doctoral consortium is to provide a venue in which students can discuss their dissertation research with experts in the field, allowing them to:

refine their research topic/focus;
receive constructive feedback from experts on completed/planned experiments, potential pitfalls, and potential future directions;
form potential collaborations.

Knowledge Representation and Semantics Highlights
We invite 2-page submissions for relevant research which has been published in a journal or presented at a (non-AMIA 2018) conference since the last AMIA (e.g., ICBO, FOIS, ISWC, ESWC, AAAI, IJCAI, etc...). Submissions should include a short abstract and description of the impact of the work. The question of why this work is a highlight should be answered. This session will allow high-impact research submitted to other venues to have more visibility among its target audience, and will allow the pre-symposium attendees to see research presented which they might otherwise have missed.


Late-Breaking Research
Two-page abstracts discussing in-progress work or incremental improvements on already published work may be submitted to be presented and discussed at the workshop. Three distinct types of submissions will be accepted:

Abstracts for preliminary results from in-progress research;
Abstracts for incremental improvements on already published research;
Abstracts for systems / software artifacts currently in development (but in a demonstrable state). This session will allow researchers to quickly disseminate new results, and to receive feedback on their in-progress research before submission to a larger conference or journal venue. Accepted abstracts in this category will be presented by poster or live system demonstration.

Please follow the standard AMIA formats for all submission types. Accepted papers/abstracts will be asked to submit multiple choice questions so that attendees may use this workshop for MOC-II credit.
